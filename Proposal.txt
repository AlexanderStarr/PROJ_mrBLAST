Sequence alignment is an invaluable tool for biological researchers.  As the amount of genetic data increases, parallelization of sequence alignment becomes necessary to maintain reasonable speeds.  Therefore, for my project, I propose to implement a parallelized BLAST algorithm using MapReduce.  The BLAST algorithm can be be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAST.  This should find sequences of high similarity between a query sequence and a genome sequence.  The reference genome I will use is the human genome contained in a public Amazon data set located at the following URL: http://aws.amazon.com/datasets/3841

As a backup to this plan, I will first implement an exact search for a query sequence in MapReduce.  This in fact is a step of the BLAST algorithm, used to find “seed” values.  This will be done with a one chromosome subset of the human genome, and run on the test machine and AWS before tackling the full project.
